Given a message, the program will encrypt it using an RSA algorithm. That is, the ASCII code of each char will be encrypted using the function c(m)=ce(mod(n)), where public n is the Carmichael Totient function (n) of two arbitrarily large prime numbers, p and q.  When sending a message, the public key n and value of e are given, such that a receiver with the private key d would be able to easily decrypt the message using (ce)d, with m(c)=cd(mod(n)). d here is the private key de-1mod((n)), where public e is some 2<e<(n)gcd(e,(n))=1. The prime numbers p and q are generated randomly, while the Carmichael Totient function can be calculated by the LCM of p-1,q-1.

Each char, after encryption, will subsequently be concatenated into a full string, with a delimiter of ‘.’. The input of the program, for example, could be “Hello World!”. The output would be some “xxxxxxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.xxxxxxxxxxxx…” etc. where the x’s represent numbers to be decrypted. The program will also output the public keys as well as the decrypted message.
